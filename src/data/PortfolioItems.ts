    shortDescription:
      "App design concept as main Master Thesis subject focused on creating a user-friendly platform for animal adoption. ",
    longDescription: "This project is centered on developing a mobile application based on User Interface and User Experience research. This application aims to simplify Cantinho do Tareco - Animal Protection Association’s current processes and turning them into more intuitive and efficient processes. The application’s main feature distinguishes itself for being based on the adoption process, although in the form of matchmaking. That way, aspects such as interactivity and gamification can be worked with in order to update a typical bureaucratic process. The remaining features cover other Association’s activities, namely Volunteering, Sponsorship, Donations, among other topics. Thus, and before any practical development, where topics such as creating personas, sketches, wireframes and prototypes lie, research was carried out to support the choices and justify the methods used, since the initial and continuous collection of information with the Association to the historical and theoretical background. In addition to responding to the restrictions raised during the research phase of this project, it is intended to reach a final user-centered product that is as complete as possible from the aesthetic and functional point of view.",

      "Academic project with the purpose of choosing a subject to map and organize it visually. The final result was of a sticker book aiming to raise animal adoption awareness.",
    longDescription: "Cantinho do Tareco is an Animal Protection Association based in facilities provided by the Maia City Hall. Currently they have about 60 cats under their care. This project began with the carbarn of litter animals from a camping pitch, where about 80 cats currently live. The Association was officially constituted in 2009 and tries to create a paradise for our little furry friends. That’s their goal, that the cats who live there feel good with the volunteers, even though they don’t have a family yet. This academic project fell under the objective of creating a system that would rate cats from the less likely to be adopted to the most likely to be adopted, dividing them by three intuitive categories: gold, silver and bronze. After some research being done, a discovery was made that some points were believed to be disfavoring some shelter cats on their search for a family. The sticker book was supposed to allure possible adoptants to choose the “golden ticket” of cats, giving that the cats under the color of gold were the less likely to be adopted.",
